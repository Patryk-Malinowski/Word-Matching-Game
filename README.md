# Word-Matching-Game

Reads the text file "word_list" that contains valid 5 letter words that the user can guess. A word is selected at random and the user has 6 guesses to guess the correct word. The user may only use other valid 5 letter words from the list as guesses. 

Any letter in a guessed word will be checked against the correct word and revealed if it is in the correct word.

The program contains safeguards to ensure correct input from the user and checking for the correct guess or completion of the correct word through other guesses.

It displays how many games the user has won after he quits the game. It also displays the users win percentage.
